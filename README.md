# The Walking Dead Universe RPG system for FoundryVTT

Unofficial Foundry VTT system for The Walking Dead Universe RPG by Free League.

**This system is not official, an official TWD system will be developed by Free League. It will not receive further updates or new functionality other than what I need to play until the official system is released.**

### System development

**Note**: only Foundry 11 or later is be supported.

If this is the first time doing it, copy the `system` folder to your Foundry `systems` folder renamed to `thewalkingdead`.

Run `npm start` from this repository.

Open a browser to http://localhost:8080.

JavaScript and CSS is refreshed by Vite automatically, any changes inside the `system` folder need to be synced manually.

```
cp -R system/* <PATH TO YOUR FOUNDRY FOLDER>/Data/systems/thewalkingdead/
```
